Compiling:
Use 'make' to compile both files, or 'make client' and 'make server' to compile the 
client and server files respectively.

Usage:
./myftpserver <port number> <terminate port> [verbose = {0}]
./myftp <server address> <port number> <terminate port>

The verbose (or testing) argument for the server is optional and will cause the server 
to output additional information when used.

The port numbers must match for the client to connect. The server address can be found
by running 'hostname -i' on the machine running the server. If the client and server
are run on the same machine, <server address> can be replaced with "self".

The shutdown command can be used from the client to shut the server down gracefully.
