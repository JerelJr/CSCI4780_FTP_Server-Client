Compiling:
Use 'make' to compile both files, or 'make client' and 'make server' to compile the 
client and server files respectively.

Usage:
./myftpserver <port number>
./myftp <server address> <port number>

The port numbers must match for the client to connect. The server address can be found
by running 'hostname -i' on the machine running the server. If the client and server
are run on the same machine, <server address> can be replaced with "self".

The shutdown command can be used from the client to shut the server down gracefully.
